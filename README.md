The Restaurant Management System is a Java-based desktop application that simplifies and automates day-to-day operations in a restaurant. Built using Java for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend, the system provides a flexible, document-oriented architecture suitable for handling dynamic restaurant data such as menus, orders, and customer information.

This project is designed for real-time management of menu items, customer orders, billing, and reservations. MongoDBâ€™s NoSQL schema enables easier handling of nested and varying order structures (e.g., customizations, modifiers, multi-course items), making it a scalable solution for modern restaurants.
